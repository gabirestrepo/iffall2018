			<b>1st group </b> text doesn't have enough contrast. It's nice that they match color scheme but find a tad darker shade. <br> Maybe for the desktop one, make the text bigger, it feels a little small for a desktop.

		<br>
			<b>2nd group of quotes: </b> 
			Text on desktop version gets a little lost on the right because the image is darker and the text is dark, <br> play with the placement to prevent this. For the mobile version I really like the way its inside the figure, maybe you can make the text a little bit bigger.
		<br>
			<b>3rd group of quotes: </b>
			For the text on the desktop I think you can make it way bigger to create a cool effect.
