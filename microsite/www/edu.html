				<p>ATDF youth programs, for children and teens, teach students about America’s own indigenous art form – Tap. Our distinguished faculty shares their knowledge of the artistry and history of tap with each student in a fun, safe and supportive environment.</p>

				<h1 class="edu">What makes our classes different?</h1>
				<p>
			The ATDF classes offer children and teens a chance to become immersed in tap culture. Classes focus on the fundamentals of rhythm tap, including clean technique, classic and contemporary tap repertory, and improvisation skills. Tap
history, films, jazz music, and special guests deepen students’ appreciation of this great American art form.

				<h1 class="edu">Tap City Youth Ensemble</h1>
				<p>These groups are the resident youth performing companies of the American Tap Dance Foundation. These dynamic and talented dancers focus on learning classic and contemporary choreography with professional choreographers, and
working with master teachers and musicians in the field today. The ensembles perform in a range of New York area venues including formal concerts, educational school shows, free public events, and television, and have been featured in articles in Dance Teacher Magazine, Dance Spirit Magazine and Time Out New York Kids and appeared on television on NY 1 and Nickelodeon's METV, and the Macy's Thanksgiving Parade on NBC.</p>
