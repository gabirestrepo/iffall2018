				It's true That all that you know is all that you are <br>
				You said that it's all that you want and more <br>
				Fuck off and pour another drink <br>
				And tell me what you think <br>
				You know that I'm too drunk to talk right now <br>
				You put your cigarette out on my face <br>
				So beautiful, please, woman <br> </p>
				<br> <br>
				<p class="prechorus">[pre-chorus] <br>
				Don't break your back for me <br>
				I'll put you out of your misery <br> </p>

				<p class="chorus" >[chorus] <br>
				Tell me that it's all okay (tell me that it's all okay) <br>
				I've been waitin' on this all damn day (waitin' on this all damn day) <br>
				Call me in the mornin', tell me how last night went <br>
				I'm here, but don't count on me to - <br> </p>
				<br> <br>
				<p class= "verse"> [verse 2] <br>
				Stay a little longer if you convince me <br>
				And tell me all the things that you have against me <br>
				Every time we make-up, the truth is fadin' <br>
				Everybody's blind when the view's amazin' <br>
				Damn, who are we right now? <br>
				Can we have a little conversation? <br>
				Figure it out with no intoxication <br>
				We carry on, what is our motivation? <br>
				We're never wrong, how the hell we gonna make it? <br>
				Maybe we're used to this <br>
				Tell me, what are we to do? <br>
				It's like we only play to lose <br>
				Chasin' pain with an excuse <br>
				I love that shit and so do you <br> </p>
				<br> <br>
				<p class="prechorus"> [pre-chorus] <br>
				But don't break your back for me <br>
				I'll put you out of your misery <br> </p>
